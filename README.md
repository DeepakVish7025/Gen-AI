🚀 Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI)
From Fundamentals to Real-World Applications

A complete, structured, and concept-driven Generative AI repository designed to build
strong foundations and practical understanding of modern AI systems like LLMs,
taking you from beginner-level concepts to real-world use cases.

---

👨‍🏫 Learning Source
Industry-standard Generative AI concepts inspired by:
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Real-world GenAI systems (ChatGPT, Copilot, Notion AI, etc.)
- Modern AI-first product design principles

This repository focuses on **how GenAI actually works internally**, not just how to use it.

---

📌 What This Repository Covers
This repository is built with a strong emphasis on:

✔ Conceptual clarity (no hype, no magic)
✔ Understanding LLM internals (tokens, context, prediction)
✔ Real-world GenAI use cases
✔ Interview-oriented explanations
✔ Learning-in-public approach

📌 Learning Philosophy
✔ Pattern over Perception – AI predicts, it doesn’t think  
✔ Concept First – Understand before building  
✔ Limitations Matter – Know what GenAI can and cannot do  
✔ Practical Understanding – Learn how real systems work  

> “Generative AI is not intelligence —  
> it is powerful pattern prediction at scale.”
